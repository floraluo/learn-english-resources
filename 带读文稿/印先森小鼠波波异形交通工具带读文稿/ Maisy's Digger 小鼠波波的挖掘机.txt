Today we're going to read Maisy's digger.
Look, this is Maisy's digger.
It has got a big wheel, a small wheel, a long arm and a bucket to hold the dirt.
What is Maisy going to do with this digger?
Let's see. 


P1
Maisy loves working in her digger.
Look, she's wearing overalls and boots.
She's ready to work.


P2
Maisy sits in the cab to drive the digger.
Today she's digging a pond in her backyard.
Do you see these levers?
Maisy pulls the levers to move the arm.
First, she moves the arm down. 
So the bucket can cut into the ground and dig up some dirt.
Dig, dig, dig! Dig up the dirt!


P3
The digger scoops up lots of dirt.
Dirt in the bucket. Dirt in the pile.
Now she's pulling a lever to lift the bucket up.
Scoop, scoop ,scoop! Scoop up the dirt.
Where does the dirt go?


P4
Maisy dumps the dirt onto a huge pile. A pile of dirt. 
And creates a hole.
Careful, Maisy! You're driving into the hole.
The digger is tilted. You might fall down.
Now the hole gets wide and big. 
This is the base of the pond.


P5
Next, Maisy collects gravels for Charley to use to line the base of the pond.
Do you know what are gravels?  
Gravel is a little stone, rock or pebbles.
Maisy drives the digger to scoop up the gravels from here.
And then dump them into the pond for Charley to use.


P6
The base of the pond is lined with gravels.
Now time to fill the water. Eddie fills the hole with water.
He grabs the water hose with his long trunk.
Splosh, splosh, splosh! In goes the water.
And Cyril plants reeds at the edge.
Here you are, Cyril. More reeds for you to plant.
Cyril is planting reeds at the other edge.


P7
Here comes Tallulah with fish!
She dumps the fish into the pond.
Plop,plop,plop! In goes three fish.
Are there any more?  Yes, in the red bucket.


P8
What a lovely pond! 
There are reeds, gravels, water, fish , a frog and a dragonfly.
Everyone loves the pond. Well done, everybody!
Good job, Maisy's digger!
Look, the arm can bend backwards when it's not working.
