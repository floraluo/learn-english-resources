Today we're going to read Maisy's Sailboat.
Look, a sailboat.
Maisy and Charley are sailing in the sea.
Hello, seagull.
What a beautiful day for sailing!


P1
Today, Maisy is sailing in her boat.
This is her boat. 
It has got a cute little flag that has a fish on it.
Who's going with her?
It's Charley. "Ahoy, Charley! Welcome aboard."
Here is your life jacket, Charley.
And here is your sailor's hat.
Look, even Panda is wearing a life jacket.
Okay, we're ready to go.


P2
(sing) Row row row your boat. We're sailing in the sea.
Whoosh whoosh! The wind blows.
Look, the flag flutters in the wind.
And Maisy's boat stars to move.
The wind is strong.
It blows Charley backward.
"Lean into the wind, Charley!" says Maisy.
The wind is blowing at us.
We need to lean forward. 
So we won't fall down.

They sail under the bridge.
Ostrich is crossing the bridge.
Hello Ostrich. And they pass the lighthouse.
Big lighthouse, small lamb.

Next stop, a beautiful blue lagoon.
There is a coconut tree.

It's a perfect spot.
Maisy drops the anchor.
We are stopping here for a while.
And Charley takes out the fishing pole.


P5
What are they going to do?
Maisy puts on her scuba gear and jumps in.
She's going scuba diving.
What does she need?
Let's take a look.
She's wearing goggles, a snorkel, a tank, a wetsuit.
Mmm, is she wearing flippers?
No, she's not wearing flippers. 


P6
In you go, splash!
What about Charley?

He's holding a fishing pole.
Will Charley catch the fish?

Back on the boat, Maisy lifts the anchor.
Time to go home.
Charley catches something.
Is it a big fish?
Surprise! It's a boot.
