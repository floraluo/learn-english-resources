Today we're going to read Maisy's bus.
Look at this green bus.
There's so many people on the bus.
Maisy and all her friends.
Where are they headed?
Let's see! 


P1
Morning Maisy!
Maisy has left her house. This is Maisy's house.
Let's see if she had locked the door. Emm, I think so.
She's ready to leave.
(sing)Good morning, driver Maisy. Driving her bus to the beach.
She's going to the beach. Who is going with her? Let's see!


P2
Bus No.1 , who's waiting? Hello, it's Dotty!
What is Dotty holding? An umbrella and a bottle.
Emm, I wonder what it is.
Who else is waiting at the bus station?
There's a hen. Cheep, cheep! 
And a Penguin . Wibble, wobble!
So Dotty is the first passenger. Hop on, Dotty. 


P3
Next is Cyril. What has Cyril got? A shopping bag.
What's in the bag?
Some bananas. So he has some food for a picnic.
Where do you think Cyril got this shopping bag?
Emm, maybe in this grocery.
The shopping bags are the same.
What's the sticking out of the window?
Ahh, it's Dotty's umbrella. It's so long.
It's even taller than Dotty.
Do you have an umbrella this big?


P4
Now they're back on the road. The roads are busy.
So many cars on the road. Can you name all the cars?
There's a bus, a van, a fire engine. Neenah, Neenah. 
And another van. Don't forget the motorbike and the bike.
They're all waiting at the crossroads.
What are they waiting for? The green light.
Oh look, the traffic light turns green now. That means go.
Red light stop! Green light go! Do you remember? 
Honk,honk! Beep, beep! The cars get going.


P6
Now they're stopping at Tallulah's house. Hop on, Tallulah. 
Tallulah is wearing a swimming ring and flying a kite.
She can't wait to splash in the water.


P7
Then it's Charley and Eddie!
What is Charley taking with him? A red bucket and a shovel.
Emm, I think he's going to play in the sand.
What about Eddie? Eddie is wearing beach shorts.
And he's trying to balance the beach ball on his head.
It seems that Eddie is well prepared for the beach.


P8
Maisy and her friends are back on the road.
They're passing by a farm.
Check out the sheep. Here's a mummy sheep and two lambs. Baa,baa!
Are we there yet? Not long now! 
Everyone sings a song.
(sing)The wheels on the bus go round and round…..


P9
Hooray! They've arrived.
They park the bus on the beach and start playing.
What a sunny day!
Let's have fun at the beach!
What is everybody doing?
Eddie is playing the beach ball with Charley.
Catch the ball, Eddie!
Oh, I think he's falling down.
But don't worry, he's wearing beach shorts.
Cyril is making a sandcastle with the bucket.
Tallulah is floating in the sea and flying her kite.
Dotty is holding an umbrella to keep from the sunshine.
What about Maisy?
Maisy is holding up the bottle.
Oh, I think she's going to put on the sun cream.
Look, she spreads out a towel on the sand.
I think she's going to have a sunbath.
Everybody is having fun.
And later when they are tired, they can have a picnic on the beach.
What a lot of fun!
Would you like to take a bus ride to the beach?
