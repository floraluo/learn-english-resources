Today we're going to read this book. Maisy's Fire Engine
Now let's take a look at the fire engine.
What color is it?
Yes it's red. It's a red shiny fire engine.
What's on top？
This is a ladder. And what is this?
This is a flashing light.
When a fire engine goes by, you can see the flashing light.
And what can you hear?
You'll hear the siren, nee nor nee nor
It tells people to stay out of the way.
So when do we need a fire engine?
Yes, when a fire breaks out!
We need a fire engine to put out the fire.
Okay let's open the book.


P1
Maisy and Cyril are driving the fire engine today.
Oh, Maisy is the driver and Cyril sits in the back.
What else is on the fire engine except for the ladder?
Yes, there is a water hose. The water hose is on board. 
(sing)I spy with my little eye. You can hear with your little ear.
A red little fire engine goes nee nor nee nor.
Stay out of the way!


P2
Now, they arrive at the fire.
It's time to put out the fire.
How do they put out the fire?
First, it's time to check the water.
So Cyril is holding the water hose. 
He says "Maisy, can you please turn on the water? "
"Okey dokey!”
Maisy turns on the water.
And out comes the water. Swoosh!


P3
Cyril sprays the water.
But there is a litter cat! Watch out! Little cat.
You'll get yourself all wet.


P4
The little black cat is scared.
She climbs onto the roof and won't come down.
Maisy and Cyril are worried.
They say"Here, Kitty Kitty ! Come down!"
"It's too high! That's not safe."


P5
The little black cat wouldn't come down.
So Maisy and Cyril need some tools to help her down.
Maisy and Cyril get the ladder.


P6
Then Maisy climbs up the ladder.
Steady steady!
Be careful on the ladder Maisy!


P7
And Maisy rescues the little black cat.
Well done! Firefighter Maisy! You're so brave!


P8
Maisy and Cyril take little black cat for a ride. Bye-bye.
And then they drive off in this red fire engine.
Bye bye Maisy！
Bye bye Cyril !
Bye bye little black cat!
Bye bye fire engine!
