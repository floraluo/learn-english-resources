Last time Maisy was driving a train. Toot toot~ 
What about this time? 
Oh, this is a race car. 
Have you seen a race car? 
A race car goes very fast. Swoosh swoosh~ 


P1
Today Maisy and her friends are going to have a race. 
Hooray! How exciting! Let's get ready! 
Maisy is washing her racecar. 
She's holding a sponge. 
Rub rub here, rub rub there. 
Oh Maisy, your sponge is dripping. 
The water gets on the floor. 
Look, the car is now clean. What a shiny red race car!


P2
The race is about to start. 
Everyone lines up at a starting line. 
Who's in the race? 
There's Maisy, Charley and Tallulah. 
What about Eddie and Cyril? 
They are cheering for them. 
Who is the judge? Ostrich. 
He's waving the flag. Ready, set, go!


P3
The race is on! 
Maisy zooms out in front and heads the first bend. 
Who's in the back? Charley and Tallulah.
They're chasing him. 


P4
Look, Maisy is driving along the track. 
And she has to make a turn here. 
So this is a first bend. 
Eddie and Cyril are watching and cheering. 
Go go go. Come on. 
But wait, who is that up ahead? 
You're blocking my way. 
Stay out of my way. 
Look, Ostrich the judge is waving a red flag. 
Red means stop. Does he want Maisy to stop?


P5
Slow down everybody. 
Tortoise is crossing the track. 
Everyone comes to a stop. 
They're waiting for Tortoise to cross the track. 
But Tortoise walks very slowly. 
They have to wait for a very long time. 


P6
Finally Tortoise crosses safely. 
The race is back on. Let's speed up. Vroom vroom.
Who's in front? Now Tallulah takes the lead. 
Come on, Maisy! Let's catch up. You can do it. 


P7
She's going really fast. Vroom vroom. 
But not fast enough. 
Charley zooms past and wins the race! 
Ostrich the judge waves the flag. 
We have a winner here. 
Look, here is the finish line. 
Charley has crossed the finish line. 
So Charley is the winner. Hooray. 
What about Tallulah and Maisy? They look surprised. 


P8
The race is done. It's time to celebrate with ice cream. 
Everyone is enjoying the ice cream. 
Even the little birdie is enjoying some bird food. 
The little black cat is drinking. 
Who do you think is the happiest? Oh Charley is. 
He's got some ice cream on his lips, but he doesn't mind. 
Why is he so happy? Because he wins the race.
